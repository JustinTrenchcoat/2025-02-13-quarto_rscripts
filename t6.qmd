title: "Tutorial 6: Refactoring R Code"
---

# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will refactor the code into separate scripts corresponding to each section. The dataset we will use comes from the `palmerpenguins` package, which contains measurements of penguins from three species.

## Load Libraries and Data

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
library(readr)
library(knitr)

data <- read_rds("output/data_clean.RDS")
data
```

# Methods

In this section, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prepare the data for modeling.

```{r}
include_graphics("output/penguin.png")

data <- read_rds("output/data_model.RDS")
data
```

# Model

We will fit a classification model using `tidymodels` to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics.

```{r}
penguin_fit <- read_rds("output/model_fit.RDS")
```

# Results

We evaluate the performance of the model using the test dataset.

```{r}
conf_mat <- read_rds("output/confusion_matrix.RDS")
conf_mat
```

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we:

- Loaded and cleaned the `palmerpenguins` dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis.
- Built a k-Nearest Neighbors classification model using `tidymodels`.
- Evaluated the model's performance.
